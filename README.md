# FRIENDSHIP ENDED WITH PLUGIN MANAGERS

### Preamble
I'm done with oh-my-zsh after years

Don't know why it got so slow, maybe it's my fault.
so, until I find something flashy that does what I want or what I really do :
[![Friendship ended](https://github.com/mvargasmoran/zsh-personal/raw/main/friendship-ended.png "Friendship ended")](http://https://github.com/mvargasmoran/zsh-personal/raw/main/friendship-ended.png "Friendship ended")

### What does it looks like?

### what's missing?
I think I need a script to create symlinks to move .zshrc to home

## What's in?
  - A modified Agnoster theme
  	https://gist.github.com/agnoster/3712874
	This provides :
	- a colored status line
	- the directory
	- the branch (if in a git dir)
	- some basic git info: such as if the repo has modified or new files
	- some zsh error marks
  - A small set of oh my zsh goodies, not the whole files, this are here to be fair, I took the stuff I used from here and there.
	- directories
[ohmyzsh directories](http://https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/directories.zsh "ohmyzsh directories")
	- git stuff
[ohmyzsh git lib pieces](http://https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/git.zsh "ohmyzsh git lib pieces")
	- git aliases, also curated from the plugin, I can't use them all
[git plugin](http://https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git "git plugin")
  - An NVM slowness patch... it will suffice for now
  	just enter .zshrc and set your nvm director thingy
## Changes
  - Removed FNM, and all it's dirty dirty stuff (replaced by: [n](https://github.com/tj/n))
  - Tried and removed starship.rs (not rust enough)
  - Removed powerlevel10k (super fast can't deal with almost no status line)
  - Removed ohmyzsh
## Trials
  - Trying zsh auto complete (I think it will doxx me)
  - Trying Ranger
